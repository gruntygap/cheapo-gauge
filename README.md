# cheapo-gauge
DIY cheap can-bus gauge, made from a box of scraps. In a cave

## Background

This gauge was created as a necessity to replace a boost gauge on my turbo miata, after a previous aftermarket unit became inaccurate (with no remediation). So my choice was to buy a replacement for ~$100, or build something. My ECU for my car is a Megasquirt 2 pnp, so CAN broadcasting was relatively easy to access.

## Needed materials
